For dependency issues, try to create a new environment:

conda env create -f environment_py27.yml

conda activate py27_pcs

##IDK why, it should be fine with creating the envirnment with the yml, but I had trouble installing pyEMMA, so you might have to install pyemma again as well 

conda install pyemma


and hopefully we are good to go
